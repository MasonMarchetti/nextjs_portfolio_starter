# personal website



Hi, I am is Mason Marchetti, and I am currently a student at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at
Columbia University persuing a Master of Science in Financial Engineering, concetrating in Machine Learning for Financial Engineering. 
I'm particularly interested in how machine learning can be applied to quantitative finance, especially in areas like predictive modeling, 
portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. Prior to Columbia, I earned a B.S. from Washington and Lee University 
where I majored in Integrated Engineering and Computer Science. In my spare time I enjoy basketball, skiing, weightlifting, poker, and electronic music. 
I built this website with the Next.js framework along with a library called Nextra, all of which you can find on my GitHub.
